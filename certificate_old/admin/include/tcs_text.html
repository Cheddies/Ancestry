<h3>3.	Your conduct</h3>
<p>
You must not use the Ancestry Shop in any way that causes, or is likely to cause, the Ancestry Shop or access to it to be interrupted, damaged or impaired in any way.
</p>
<p>
You must not use the Ancestry Shop for fraudulent purposes, or in connection with a criminal offence or other unlawful activity.
</p>
<h3>4.	Access to the Ancestry Shop</h3>
<p>
We will do our best to ensure that availability of the Ancestry Shop will be uninterrupted and that transmissions will be error-free. However, due to the nature of the Internet, this cannot be guaranteed. Since all we can do is control the servers hosting the Ancestry Shop, we are not responsible if you cannot access it properly or at all because your ISP connection, the Internet generally or your browser software is inadequate or functioning badly or not at all, or if your ISP suspends or terminates their service to you, or because of any other event outside our control. If you cannot access the Ancestry Shop properly or at all because of any of these reasons, we will not refund any money you have paid.
</p>
<h3>5.	Placing an order </h3>
<p>
We have set out below a summary of the steps that you need to follow in order to place an order to purchase any of the goods that appear on the Ancestry Shop and thereby conclude a legally binding contract with us for the sale of the relevant goods. 
</p>

<h4>Step one:  Add Items to Your Shopping Basket</h4>
<p>
Select the items that you wish to purchase and add these to your shopping basket. When you are ready proceed to the checkout.
</p>

<h4>Step two:  Enter address details for billing and delivery</h4>
<p>
You will be required to enter your address details for delivery and, if different, for payment. You will need to retype these details at each shopping occasion.
</p>

<h4>Step three:  Review and confirmation</h4>
<p>
You will be given the opportunity to review and confirm the details of your order, including the delivery address, preferred payment method and product details. No credit card details are taken at this stage.
</p>
<h4>Step four:  Checkout</h4>
<p>
You will be required to enter details of the credit card or payment method with which you wish to pay and you will be given an opportunity to accept or reject further communications from The Generations Network (Commerce) Limited, The Generations Network, Inc. and carefully selected third parties. 
</p>
<h3>6.	Email confirmation</h3>
<p>
When you place an order for any product from the Ancestry Shop, we will send you an email confirming receipt of your order, together with your order number for reference.   
</p>
<p>
We recommend you print and save a copy of this confirmatory email, together with a copy of these terms and conditions for your records. 
</p>
<p>
Your order represents an offer to us to purchase a product which is accepted by us when the products ordered by you have been dispatched or we send an e-mail to you stating that we've dispatched that product to you (<strong>"the Dispatch Email"</strong>). That acceptance will be complete at the time we send the Dispatch Email to you or the products have been dispatched if no Dispatch Email is to be sent unless we have notified you that we do not accept your order, or you have cancelled it in accordance with the instructions in condition 9, "Returns and Refunds". Any products on the same order which we have not confirmed in the Dispatch Email to have been dispatched do not form part of that contract. 
</p>
<p>
The contract between you and us for the sale of any product will therefore be made and become binding on both you and us when we have dispatched your order. That acceptance will be deemed complete and will be deemed for all purposes to have been effectively communicated to you at the time that we send the e-mail to you (whether or not you receive that e-mail) or the products have been dispatched. If we are unable to fulfil your order for any reason, we will inform you by email and your order will be cancelled. Where this is the case, and we have processed your payment we will refund or credit your credit or debit card. 
</p>
<h3>7.	Payment</h3>
<p>
You will also receive an e-mail from Secure Trading who manage payment card processing for us, regarding validation of your method of payment. If accepted, your credit or debit card will be debited. If rejected, and you do not provide an alternative credit or debit card which is accepted, the order will not be processed. We use Secure Trading to validate your payment online before you receive an order number. Secure Trading uses software to check for fraudulent use and link to the banks for credit limits and notification of lost and stolen cards. The receipt of an email from Secure Trading is to confirm that they have been authorised to process payment.  It does not create a binding contract between us and you.
</p>

<a name="returns"><h3>8.Processing and Delivery of your Order</h3></a>
<p>
We reserve the right, at any time prior to our communicating our acceptance to you, to refuse any order or any part of an order, or to require further or better information to enable us to evaluate and/or process the order.
</p>
<p>
We will do all we reasonably can to meet a delivery time but where, for circumstances beyond our reasonable control we cannot do so, we will contact you and advise of an alternative date. If we are unable to fulfil your order for any reason, we will inform you by email and your order will be cancelled. The risk in any goods you purchase and the responsibility to insure them will pass to you when the relevant goods are delivered to you. 
</p>

<h3>9.	Returns and refunds </h3>
<p>
It is important to us that you are satisfied with your Ancestry Shop experience. If you are not completely satisfied with our goods you have the right to cancel your order up to 21 days after receipt of your product and receive a full order refund or exchange. We will make all refunds to the card used for payment as soon as possible which we would expect to be within 30 days of the date of cancellation.  The refund will be the cost of the returned goods together with the original delivery fee if the goods are being returned because they can be shown to have been faulty or damaged when they were received by you.  Please note that this does not apply to items personalised or made to your specification; audio or video recordings or computer software (such as CD-ROMs and DVDs) which you have opened, unwrapped or unsealed; newspapers, periodicals or magazines; or perishable goods.  
</p>
<p>
Following any cancellation of the contract you are required to return to us within 21 days those product(s) which you no longer wish to purchase and keep.  Under these circumstances you must return the product(s) to us in good condition (either in person or by post).  We reserve the right to refuse returns or to charge you our fees and expenses if the product is received otherwise than in accordance with this requirement. We reserve the right to charge you the cost of returning the items by post.  
</p>
<p>
Where you are withdrawing from your purchase up to 21 days after receipt of your product, and there has been no error on our part (including faulty goods), we will refund only the cost of the item.  We will not refund the cost of delivery or other services provided to you in connection with your purchase. Please note that you will be responsible for the costs of returning the items to us unless we delivered the item to you in error or if the item is damaged or defective.
</p>
<p>
If you would like to return an item please contact us on 0870 850 8752 or email service@ancestryshop.co.uk where we will be able to provide you with a return authorisation which will speed up your return and refund process.  Alternatively please send you goods in their original condition and packaging to the address in the "Contact Us" at section 2 above marked "Returns".  
</p>
<p>
It is your right to cancel your order within 21 days of receipt of the goods by notifying us of your intentions.  Please notify us by email at service@ancestryshop.co.uk or call us on 0870 850 8752. This "Returns and refunds" policy does not take away any rights you may have under consumer law.
</p>

<h3>10.	Customs</h3>
<p>
When ordering goods from us for delivery overseas you may have to pay import duties and taxes, which are levied once the package reaches the specified destination. These and any other additional charges for customs clearance must be borne by you; we have no control over these charges and cannot predict what they may be. Customs policies vary widely from country to country, so you should contact your local customs office for further information. Additionally, please note that when ordering from us, you must comply with all laws and regulations of the country in which you are receiving the goods.
